Everyone
/*
  For creating the main class everyone met up together. There was one designated person who wrote the code, but we all contreibuted our ideas for what we thought we should add for functionality. 
  In the end we all also collectively looked at each class together and updated/enhanced our code together.
  Testing was also done by everyone simultaneously. We all ran tests on our own devices to see if anything broke. We were mostly succesful at catching most of our error.
