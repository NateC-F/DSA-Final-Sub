Background Info
For our task we decided to try and make a task manager app. For this we knew that we would want to keep this project simple for now but also make it modular for us to come back and adapt for future additional features. For this modular characteristic we started off by making a factory design pattern for different kinds of profiles. Some profiles that could be added would be a premium account that would allow the user to have a larger circular queue to add more than 10 tasks at a time. Some profiles can have a different kind of queue implementation, while the default Tasks class just deals with a circular queue, we can make one that uses a priority queue and can assign different weights to tasks and which ones should be completed first, rather than a FIFO structure.
